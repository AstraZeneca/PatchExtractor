# PatchExtractor:
A fast and easy WSI patch-extraction tool.

Please see [__the documentation__](https://fluffy-doodle-reqwg84.pages.github.io/).

## Why use this tool?
In computational pathology projects, we invariably have to stop and consider the extraction of patches from WSIs in order to facilitate our analysis. This is often slow, boring and and not what you want to spend your time and energy on.

Using this tool could make your life easier.

## Main advantages

- Multiple masking methods:
  - Different histological stains, staining protocols and WSI scanners give rise to weird and wonderful variability in images which are more or less conducive to certain tissue masking methods.
  - The choice of multiple methods can help with this.
